# Web-Dev and DSA
This repository aims to be the daily tracker of my 9 months of Coding that I will learn from the Sigma Batch of Apna College.
For the first 4.5 months, we will be taught Full Stack Web Development and the later 4-4.5 months will be focused on DSA.
Lectures will be uploaded every alternate day with the break days dedicated to practice days where I will be revising the concepts and solving practice problems based on those concepts.
